====================================

<div class="date">${date}</div>

It's always easier to continue than start. With that in mind, allow me
to just keep on writing, in the same fashion as
[my previous attempt](http://blogger.popcnt.org/).

Although I stopped writing the "Majek's technical blog" more than two
years ago, some of my old writings are still valid and bring nice
memories about my previous state of the mind.

I really hope this place will be of similar value and quality.
