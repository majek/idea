====================================

<div class="date">${date.strftime('%d %B %Y')}</div>

Starting is usually hard, it's much easier to just continue. With that
in mind, allow me to keep on writing, in the same fashion as
[my previous blog](http://blogger.popcnt.org/).

Although I wrote my last post on
["Majek's technical blog"](http://blogger.popcnt.org/) more than two
years ago, I'm still eager to spread my ideas.

Surprisingly, some of my old writings are still valid and bring back
memories about my previous state of the mind.

I hope this place won't be much worse.
