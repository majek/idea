Let me assure you, the
["fluxcapacitor"](https://github.com/majek/fluxcapacitor#fluxcapacitor)
project is very interesting. Unfortunately, I find it very difficult
to describe what it does. For this project I completely fail the
[elevator pitch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevator_pitch).

I won't attempt to describe it, instead I'll try present it in action.


Prerequisites
---

First, you need to compile the fluxcapacitor (FC), it's supposed to be
simple:

```
::bash
$ sudo aptitude install git gcc make
$ git clone https://github.com/majek/fluxcapacitor.git
$ cd fluxcapacitor
$ make
```

If you're lucky you should have FC up and running:

```
$ ./fluxcapacitor --help
Usage:
 fluxcapacitor [options] [ -- command [ arguments ... ] ... ]
```

Introduction
---

Fluxcapacitor runs any program in an special environment which has
different view on passing time than the rest of the operating
system. From a point of view of a program everything is normal, but if
you observe it from outside you'll see it run "faster". You can say
fluxcapacitor speeds up the flow of time for the program. For example:

```
::shell
$ time sleep 12
real    0m12.003s

$ time ./fluxcapacitor -- sleep 12
real    0m0.057s
```

Both times `sleep` thinks 12 seconds had passed. But in the second
case the observer would disagree - it only took a few milliseconds to
finish. `Sleep` isn't able to realize that.

Notice the `time` command was run _outside_ fluxcapacitor
environment. If you run it inside, it will surely report 12 seconds:

```
$ ./fluxcapacitor -- bash -c "time sleep 12"
real    0m12.016s
```

Let's make the example more extreme:

```
::shell
$ ./fluxcapacitor -- bash -c "sleep 315360000; date"
Sat Jul 15 11:36:23 BST 2023
```

We briefly went to the year 2023.


How to sleep a million years
---

You can try sleeping for any time you wish. Unfortunately my operating
system (bash?) can't express dates after the year 2550:

```
::bash
$ ./fluxcapacitor --idleness=0 -- bash -c ${"\\"}
    'for i in `seq 1 100`; do sleep 315360000; date; done'
Sat Jul 15 11:38:25 BST 2023
Tue Jul 12 11:38:25 BST 2033
Fri Jul 10 11:38:25 BST 2043
...
Sun Apr 28 11:38:26 BST 2543
Wed Apr 25 11:38:26 BST 2553
Tue Oct  3 12:03:52 BST 1978
Fri Sep 30 12:03:52 BST 1988
...
```

Fluxcapacitor is very powerful, let's jump to more sophisticated
examples.


Speeding up sleep sort
---

In 2011 someone on 4chan invented the
["sleep sort" algorithm](http://dis.4chan.org/read/prog/1295544154):

```
::bash
#!/bin/bash
function f() {
    sleep "$1"
    echo -n "$1 "
}
while [ -n "$1" ]
do
    f "$1" &
    shift
done
wait
echo
```

It sorts numbers by spawning many processes and waiting approriate
number of seconds. For example:

```
$ time ./sleepsort.sh 5 3 6 3 6 3 1 4 7
1 3 3 3 4 5 6 6 7
real    0m7.012s
```

Although this was intended as a joke, with fluxcapacitor you can run it
in a fraction of a second:

```
$ time ./fluxcapacitor -- ./sleepsort.sh 5 3 6 3 6 3 1 4 7
1 3 3 3 4 5 6 6 7
real    0m0.056s
```

For the curious: the complexity of sleep search on
fluxcapacitor is `O(n^2)`.

Advanced usage
---

Sleep sort forked many processes and fluxcapacitor is able to guard
any number of OS processes or threads. You can spawn many commands by
delimiting the command line with two dashes `--`:

```
::bash
$ time ./fluxcapacitor ${"\\"}
   -- bash -c "sleep 60; date" ${"\\"}
   -- bash -c "sleep 120; date"
Wed Jul 17 13:14:01 BST 2013
Wed Jul 17 13:15:01 BST 2013
real    0m0.179s
```

With many processes things get really interesting.

Memcached expiration
---

Let's try to use do something more
complicated. [Memcached](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memcached), a
caching daemon, can expire an item after a timeout. Let's try to test it
using fluxcapacitor. We need to run two processes within FC:

 * "server" - the memcached deamon:

```
/tmp/memcached-1.4.15/memcached -p 1121
```

 * "client" - a simple bash script. It will set the key with
   appropriate expiry timeout, check if it's there, wait some time and
   check for the key again. Finally we need to kill the memcached
   daemon. The code:

```
# 1) set key foo with timeout of 60 seconds
echo -e "set foo 0 60 2\r\naa"|nc localhost 1121
# 2) is foo still there? (it should)
echo "get foo"|nc localhost 1121
# 3) wait for 70 seconds
sleep 70
# 4) is foo still there? (it shouldn't)
echo "get foo"|nc localhost 1121
# 5) cleanup, don't need memcached anymore
killall memcached
```

It would be better to write a proper script for the "client" part, but
we can also run it inline as a parameter to `bash -c`. Here it goes:

```
$ time ./fluxcapacitor -- /tmp/memcached-1.4.15/memcached -p 1121 -- bash -c 'echo -e "set foo 0 60 2\r\naa"|nc localhost 1121; echo "get foo"|nc localhost 1121; sleep 70; echo "get foo"|nc localhost 1121; killall memcached'
STORED
VALUE foo 0 2
aa
END
END

real    0m0.521s
```

Memcached behaves as it should. The test takes about 500ms, instead of
70 seconds it would take without the FC.

You may want to pass `--idleness=5ms` option to FC to make it go
fast. Without this option the test takes about 4 seconds.

In fact, fluxcapacitor is intended for similar scenarios - to make
network protocol tests run faster. It's especially useful when
mocking a time library is not an option - just like in our memcached
example.

Redis expiration
---

Let's repeat the same test with redis. Again, we need:

 * "server" - a redis deamon
```
/tmp/redis-2.6.14/src/redis-server --port 7379
```

 * "client" - as previously:
```
# 1) set key foo with expiry time of 60 seconds and check it
echo -en "SET foo aa EX 60\r\nGET foo\r\n"|nc localhost 7379
# 2) wait 70 seconds
sleep 70
# 3) is foo still there? (it shouldn't)
echo -en "GET foo\r\n"|nc localhost 7379
# 4) cleanup
killall redis-server
```

To run it:
```
./fluxcapacitor --idleness=1ms -- /tmp/redis-2.6.14/src/redis-server --port 7379 -- bash -c 'echo -en "SET foo aa EX 60\r\nGET foo\r\n"|nc localhost 7379; sleep 70; echo -en "GET foo\r\n"|nc localhost 7379; killall redis-server'
+OK
$2
aa
$-1

real    0m1.109s
```

Wrapper scripts
---

I wouldn't recommend stacking very long parameters to fluxcapacitor
for any serious application. Instead, you should create a wrapper
script that spawns all the processes you need. This is a python script to run the redis
test (derived from
[a fluxcapacitor example](https://github.com/majek/fluxcapacitor/blob/master/examples/slowecho/run_test.py)):

```
::python
#!/usr/bin/env python
import os, time, signal, socket

server_pid = os.fork()
if server_pid == 0:
    os.execv("/tmp/redis-2.6.14/src/redis-server",
             ['redis-server', '--port', '7379'])
    os._exit(0)
else:
    time.sleep(1)
    s = socket.socket()
    s.connect(('127.0.0.1', 7379))
    s.send('SET foo aa EX 60\r\n')
    assert s.recv(1024) == '+OK\r\n'
    s.send('GET foo\r\n')
    assert s.recv(1024) == '$2\r\naa\r\n'
    time.sleep(70)
    s.send('GET foo\r\n')
    assert s.recv(1024) == '$-1\r\n'
    os.kill(server_pid, signal.SIGINT)
```

Run it as usual:

```
$ ./fluxcapacitor --idleness=1ms -- ./run_redis_test.py
```

Final note
---

Fluxcapacitor is really good at speeding up client/server or protocol
tests.

Actually fluxcapacitor was originally created to speed up the
[`sockjs-protocol`](https://github.com/sockjs/sockjs-protocol) test
suite. It wasn't possible to mock up a time library - we needed to run
the tests against any sockjs http server, whether it's in
[erlang](https://github.com/sockjs/sockjs-erlang),
[node.js](https://github.com/sockjs/sockjs-node) or
[python](https://github.com/mrjoes/sockjs-tornado). It turns out the
only way to run timeout-related tests in a reasonable time is to use
fluxcapacitor.

You might ask how fluxcapacitor works. In short - it uses `ptrace` to
catch syscalls like `clock_gettime` or `gettimeofday` and overwrite
the kernel response with a fake time. Additionally it short-circuits
syscalls that can block for a timeout like `select` or `poll`. For technical details
see the
[README](https://github.com/majek/fluxcapacitor#fluxcapacitor).
