A TCP/IP connection is identified by a four element tuple: {source IP,
source port, destination IP, destination port}. To establish a TCP/IP
connection only a destination IP and port number are needed, the
operating system automatically selects source IP and port. This
article explains how the Linux kernel does the source port allocation.


Ephemeral port range
----

To establish a connection
[BSD API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_sockets) requires two
steps: first you need to create a socket, then call `connect()` on
it. Here's some code in Python:

```.python
s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
s.connect(("www.google.com", 80))
```

When a connection is made the operating system needs to select an
unused source port number. Linux selects a port from an
[ephemeral port range](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephemeral_port),
which by default is a set to range from 32768 to 61000:

```.bash
$ cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_port_range
32768   61000
```

On Linux the ephemeral port range is a global resource[^1], it's not a
specific setting local to an IP address.

[within a container](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/4ba9920e5e9c0e16b5ed24292d45322907bb9035/net/ipv4/inet_connection_sock.c#L118),
kudos to [David](https://twitter.com/dwragg) for pointing this out.

Let's dig into details on how exactly a source port is selected. The
main work is done in the
[`__inet_hash_connect` function.](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/1bbdceef1e535add893bf71d7b7ab102e4eb69eb/net/ipv4/inet_hashtables.c#L501)
Here's an excerpt (with many lines of code removed for simplicity):

```.c
static u32 hint;

inet_get_local_port_range(net, &low, &high);
remaining = (high - low) + 1;

for (i = 1; i <= remaining; i++) {
	port = low + (i + hint) % remaining;
	head = &hinfo->bhash[inet_bhashfn(net, port,
			hinfo->bhash_size)];

	inet_bind_bucket_for_each(tb, &head->chain) {
		if (net_eq(ib_net(tb), net) &&
		    tb->port == port) {
			if (tb->fastreuse >= 0 ||
			    tb->fastreuseport >= 0)
				goto next_port;
			if (!check_established(death_row, sk,
						port, &tw))
				goto ok;
			goto next_port;
		}
	}

	tb = inet_bind_bucket_create(hinfo->bind_bucket_cachep,
			net, head, port);
	goto ok;

next_port:
}
[...]
ok:
	hint += i;
```

In translation: we start with a `hint` port number[^2] and increase it
until we find a source port that is either:

 1. Completely unused.

 2. Used by some connections but it's ok for it to be reused: it
    passes the `check_established` check.

[^2]: Notice it's static variable, shared between containers. You can
use it to check the connection chrun on
[your Heroku dyno](https://news.heroku.com/news_releases/heroku-announces-major-new-version-celadon-cedar-includes-new-process-model-full-nodejs-).

By default there are 28232 ports in the ephemeral range, so the first
condition could be matched at most that number of times. If you have
more than 28k connections Linux will need to find a port that passes
[`check_established`](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/1bbdceef1e535add893bf71d7b7ab102e4eb69eb/net/ipv4/inet_hashtables.c#L344)
check. It's okay to reuse a port if no connection already exists
between the same source and destination endpoints.

With multiple destination addresses it's possible to have pretty much
unlimited[^3] number of connections. But establishing more than 28k
concurrent connections to a single {destination IP, destination port}
pair will fail.

[^3]: Limited only by available memory, `ulimit -n` and
`/proc/sys/fs/file-max`.

What if you really want to establish more than 28k connections to a
single destination? There are a couple of tweaks you can make:

 1. Increase the `ip_local_port_range` pool. Setting it to maximum
    range will allow 64511 concurrent connections (65535-1024).

 2. Set [`tcp_tw_reuse` sysctl](http://stackoverflow.com/a/12719362)
    to
    [enable reusing of TIME_WAIT sockets](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/1bbdceef1e535add893bf71d7b7ab102e4eb69eb/net/ipv4/tcp_ipv4.c#L127).

 3. Do *not* set `tcp_tw_recycle`. It will cause SYN's to be dropped
    for users behind a NAT.

If you really want to establish even more than 64k connections to a
single destination address you'll have to use more than one source IP
address.

Bind before connect
-------------------

It is possible to ask the kernel to select a specific source IP and
port by calling `bind()` before calling `connect()`:

```.python
s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
# Let the source address be 192.168.1.21:1234
s.bind(("192.168.1.21", 1234))
s.connect(("www.google.com", 80))
```

This trick is often called, wait for it..., "bind before
connect". Specifying port number `0` means that the kernel should do a
port allocation for us:

```.python
s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
s.bind(("192.168.1.21", 0))
s.connect(("www.google.com", 80))
```

This method is fairly well known, but there's a catch. `Bind` is
usually called for listening sockets so the kernel needs to make sure
that the source address is not shared with anyone else. It's a
problem. When using this techique in this form it's impossible to
establish more than 64k (ephemeral port range) outgoing connections in
total. After that the attempt to call `bind()` will fail with an
`EADDRINUSE` error - all the source ports will be busy.


To work around this we need to understand two flags that affect the
kernel port allocation behaviour: `SO_REUSEADDR` and `SO_REUSEPORT`.

${"###"} SO_REUSEADDR

`SO_REUSEADDR` is mentioned in only two man pages:

Man `ip(7)`:

> A TCP local socket address that has been bound is unavailable for
  some time after closing, unless the SO_REUSEADDR flag has been set.
  Care should be taken when using this flag as it makes TCP less
  reliable.

Man `socket(7)`:

> SO_REUSEADDR: Indicates that the rules used in validating addresses
  supplied in a bind(2) call should allow reuse of local addresses.
  For AF_INET sockets this means that a socket may bind, except when
  there is an active listening socket bound to the address.  When the
  listening socket is bound to INADDR_ANY with a specific port then it
  is not possible to bind to this port for any local address.
  Argument is an integer boolean flag.

Don't worry if it sounds confusing, here's how I understand it:

By setting `SO_REUSEADDR` user informs the kernel of an intention to
share the bound port with anyone else, but only if it doesn't cause a
conflict on the protocol layer. There are at least three situations
when this flag is useful:

1. Normally after binding to a port and stopping a server it's
   neccesary to wait for a socket to time out before another server
   can bind to the same port. With `SO_REUSEADDR` set it's possible
   to rebind immediately, even if the socket is in a `TIME_WAIT`
   state.

2. When one server binds to `INADDR_ANY`, say `0.0.0.0:1234`, it's
   impossible to have another server binding to a specific address
   like `192.168.1.21:1234`. With `SO_REUSEADDR` flag this behaviour
   is allowed.

3. When using the bind before connect trick only a single connection
   can use a single outgoing source port. With this flag, it's
   possible for many connections to reuse the same source port, given
   that they connect to different destination addresses.

${"###"} SO_REUSEPORT

`SO_REUSEPORT` is poorly documented. It was introduced for UDP
multicast sockets. Initially, only a single server was able to use a
particular port to listen to a multicast group. This flag allowed
different sockets to bind to exactly the same IP and port, and receive
datagrams for
[selected multicast groups](http://stackoverflow.com/a/2741989).

More generally speaking, setting `SO_REUSEPORT` infroms a kernel of an
intention to share a particular bound port between many processes, but
only for a single user. For multicast datagrams are distributed based
on multicast groups, for usual `UDP` datagrams are distributed in
round-robin way. For a long time this flag wasn't available for `TCP`
sockets, but recently Google submitted patches that fix it and
distribute incoming connections
[in round-robin way between listening sockets](https://lwn.net/Articles/542629/).

The best explanation of these flags I found
[in this stackoverflow answer](http://stackoverflow.com/a/14388707).

Port allocation
----

With `0` passed to `bind` the kernel does a source port allocation:

```.python
s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
s.bind(("192.168.1.21", 0))
```

This type of port allocation works differently than when using
straight `connect()`. I won't paste
[the kernel code](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/1bbdceef1e535add893bf71d7b7ab102e4eb69eb/net/ipv4/inet_connection_sock.c#L112)
here, it's rather brutal. Basically, the kernel doesn't use `hint`
variable as previously, instead it selects a random port from the
ephemeral range and
[increases it until it finds a conflict-free port](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/1bbdceef1e535add893bf71d7b7ab102e4eb69eb/net/ipv4/inet_connection_sock.c#L112).

What is
[a "conflict-free" very much depends on the `SO_REUSEADDR` and `SO_REUSEPORT` flags](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/1bbdceef1e535add893bf71d7b7ab102e4eb69eb/net/ipv4/inet_connection_sock.c#L63).

Although supported by the code, setting `SO_REUSEPORT` and asking
kernel to allocate a port number makes little sense. I doubt it's used
by anyone (prove me wrong!).

On the other hand `SO_REUSEADDR` is very handy. Usage example:


```.python
s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
s.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1)
s.bind(("192.168.1.21", 0))
s.connect(("www.google.com", 80))
```

In this case the kernel will find a port that doesn't directly
conflict with other socket but, as opposed to the lack of
`SO_REUSEADDR` setting, ports in `TIME_WAIT` and used by already
established connections may be reused. Therefore by setting
`SO_REUSEADDR` flag it is possible to have more than 64k (ephemeral
port range) outgoing connections from a single selected IP to multiple
destinations.

But there's another catch: when we call `bind()` the kernel knows only
the source address we're asking for. We'll inform the kernel of a
destination address only when we call `connect()` later. This may lead
to problems as kernel may reuse source port already used by another
connection possibly to the same desitnation we want to use. In such
case `connect()` will fail with `EADDRNOTAVAIL` error. Here's a code
handling this situation:

```.python
for i in range(RETRIES):
    s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    s.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1)
    s.bind(("192.168.1.21", 0))
    try:
        s.connect(("www.google.com", 80))
        break
    except socket.error, e:
        if e.errno != errno.EADDRNOTAVAIL:
            raise
else:
    raise Exception("Failed to find an unused source port")
```

If you want to establish more than 64k (ephemeral port range)
connections to a single destination, you need to use all the tricks:

 - Tweak kernel parameters to increase ephemeral port range.

 - Manually specify many source IP addresses by using bind before
   connect.

 - Set `SO_REUSEADDR` flag on outging connections.

 - Check `bind()` for `EADDRINUSE` errors, in case we run out of
   available ports.

 - Check `connect()` for `EADDRNOTAVAIL` errors in case there is a
   connection conflict and retry if neccesary.


Don't mix
---------

Unfortunately, connections established with normal `connect` and with
bind before connect don't mix well. Outgoing ports used by one
technique can't be reused by another. If you establish 64k connections
using `connect`, `bind` will fail with `EADDRINUSE`. And the other way
around: when thousands of connections are using bind before connect
straight `connect` might fail with `EADDRNOTAVAIL`.

Summary
----

To wrap it up:

 - If you can, just use straight `connect()`, the kernel does a good
   job at allocating source ports.

 - If you need to select a source IP manually, for whatever reason,
   normally you'll be limited to one outgoing connection for one
   ephemeral port: destination address is not taken into
   account. This limits number of outgoing connections considerably.

 - Therefore if you need to specify a source IP consider setting
   `SO_REUSEADDR` flag to enable address reuse. This will increase
   number of possible connections, but you will need to handle
   possible `connect()` `EADDRNOTAVAIL` errors.

 - When calling `bind()` consider selecting other IP addresses than the
   default outgoing IP address for your network. Filling ephemeral
   range on the default outgoing IP may cause problems with
   applications that use normal `connect()`.
