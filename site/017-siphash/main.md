On 29C3 djb, Jean-Philippe Aumasson and Martin BoÃŸlet gave a very
interesting
[talk on SipHash](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2012/Fahrplan/events/5152.en.html)
([see the video](http://media.ccc.de/browse/congress/2012/29c3-5152-en-hashflooding_dos_reloaded_h264.html)).

In short - [SipHash](https://131002.net/siphash/) is a new hash,
created especially to save you from hash flooding attacks. The hash
takes two parameters - a 128 bit "secret" key and an arbitrary data
blob. This is different from traditional hashes which required only a
data blob as an input. SipHash outputs a secure 64 bit hash.

SipHash is described in detail in the extremely well written
[paper](https://131002.net/siphash/siphash.pdf).

python
----

SipHash seems to be pretty easy to implement - I took a chance and
implemented it in Python:
[https://github.com/majek/pysiphash](https://github.com/majek/pysiphash).

Use `pip` for the installation:

    $ pip install siphash

Usage is rather obvious:

```
:::python
>>> import siphash
>>> key = '0123456789ABCDEF'
>>> siphash.SipHash_2_4(key, 'a').hash()
12398370950267227270L
```

c
----

I also wrote a
[C version](https://github.com/majek/csiphash/blob/master/csiphash.c),
although I must admit the code is quite closely based on the
[reference implementation](https://131002.net/siphash/siphash24.c).

The minimalistic usage example:

```
:::c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <string.h>

uint64_t siphash24(const char *in, unsigned long inlen,
                   const char k[16]);

int main() {
	char key[16] = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0xa,0xb,0xc,0xd,0xe,0xf};
	char *pt = "hello world!";
	uint64_t hash = siphash24(pt, strlen(pt), key);
	printf("plaintext=%s hash=%llu\n", pt, hash);
	return 0;
}
```


In my
[C SipHash implementation](https://github.com/majek/csiphash/blob/master/csiphash.c)
I tried to keep the code as short and as readable as possible. In
total the code is 90-odd lines long of which around half is real
code.

45 lines of C code is an excellent result for a strong hash. Thanks
Jean-Philippe for a great hash!
