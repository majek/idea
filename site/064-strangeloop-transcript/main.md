I recently gave a talk at the
[Strange Loop](http://www.thestrangeloop.com/) conference in St Louis.

The [recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79u7bURE6Ss) and
[slides](https://speakerdeck.com/majek04/ip-spoofing) are available,
but for easier consumption here's a transcript.



<div class="image" style="height:364px"><img style="height:336px;" src="strange-loop3-iwi-09-09.001.jpg"></div>

Good morning! This is the DDoS talk. It's always hard to speak about
DDoS. Many people mean very different things by it. Some say "DDoS"
when their Ruby app can't handle more than five concurrent users.

But slow Ruby servers are not the subject of this talk. Here, I'm
going to talk about one specific kind of DDoS attacks - the really big
ones, the ones that make it to the news. Perhaps you've read headlines
like "a DDoS attack that threatens the internet". This presentation
will explain all the technical details behind attacks like that.

<hr><div class="image" style="height:364px"><img style="height:336px;" src="strange-loop3-iwi-09-09.002.jpg"></div>

Before we start let me give you a roadmap of this talk. First I'll
explain the Distributed Denial Of Service attacks, or DDoS,
attacks. These are the attacks where somebody uses many machines to
deny the access to some internet service. Basically try to take
someone off the internet.

Then I'll make a case that IP spoofing, which is faking the IP addresses,
allows the most serious attacks. I'll explain why it's impossible to
trace the offender. I'll show examples of
sophisticated attacks are possible due to IP spoofing.

I'll conclude that the only way to defend from such attacks is to
invest in expensive infrastructure. This is one of the
forces that leads to the centralization of the internet.

Finally I'll show how to untangle this mess. I'll explain what can be
done to fix the problem.

Ok, let's start up, let me explain why DDoS attacks are a problem.

<hr><div class="image" style="height:364px"><img style="height:336px;" src="strange-loop3-iwi-09-09.003.jpg"></div>

But why should I know anything about that?

Allow me introduce myself. My name is Marek and I'm an engineer at a
performance and security company called CloudFlare.

At CloudFlare we operate a service - a globally distributed reverse proxy.

We run servers all around the world. At last count we were present in
86 locations [^hund]. We see a big chunk of traffic crossing the
internet.

[^hund]: This is outdated! Now [Cloudflare has 100 points of presence](https://blog.cloudflare.com/amsterdam-to-zhuzhou-cloudflare-global-network/).

<hr><div class="image" style="height:364px"><img style="height:336px;" src="strange-loop3-iwi-09-09.004.jpg"></div>

We have plenty of customers from many different countries and from all
industries: from dating portals through social media sites to
government agencies. But most importantly we are content neutral.

We try not to discriminate websites based on the content they provide.

<hr><div class="image" style=""><img style="height:336px;" src="strange-loop3-iwi-09-09.005.jpg"></div>

Operating a content neutral service in today's internet is a tough
job. Some people dislike some websites, and they want to stop them
from being available on the internet. The easiest way to do so is to launch a
DDoS attack.

Being a middle man Cloudflare sees many of these attacks. This is not
scaremongering, the attacks do happen all the time.

Here's a chart of last 90 days of the attacks we saw. The X axis shows
time - in days, the Y axis shows number of DDoS events we saw on that
day. On slower days we saw between 50 and 200 DDoS events, on
busier days we saw up to 1200 separate incidents.


<hr><div class="image" style=""><img style="height:336px;" src="strange-loop3-iwi-09-09.006.jpg"></div>

But fighting these attacks is not something we do because it's fun. In
order to survive on the internet we had to adapt and learn how to
withstand them.

Believe me, nobody enjoys handling attacks. This is a huge distraction
and we'd much rather spend time on doing something constructive. It
would be awesome if it was possible to fix the internet and solve the
attacks one day.

As a part of a wider effort to help others with DDoS, we try to share
our DDoS mitigation experience. We are trying to make public as much
of the details as we can.

<hr><div class="image" style="height:364px"><img style="height:336px;" src="strange-loop3-iwi-09-09.007.jpg"></div>

Over the years we published many stories of record breaking
attacks. In this presentation I'll focus on three specific big
attacks: Spamhaus DNS amplifications from 2013, the direct attacks we
dubbed "Winter of attacks" from March this year and a new type of
attacks we noticed only recently which I call a "Direct subnet"
attacks.

Don't worry if these names don't mean much to you, I'll explain the
details later in this talk.

It's very important to understand that these record breaking attacks
are not coming out of the void. All of them had two things in common.

<hr><div class="image" style="height:364px"><img style="height:336px;" src="strange-loop3-iwi-09-09.008.jpg"></div>



(Almost)[^krebs] All of these big attacks share two important characteristics.

[^krebs]: Editor note: this presentation was prepared before the
[Krebs On Security](http://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/09/krebsonsecurity-hit-with-record-ddos)
DDoS attacks which had a different profile and did _not_ use Spoofed
IP addresses. Krebs's DDoS attacks launched by internet-of-things
devices were unusually large. Most of the non-spoofed attacks were way
smaller.  This does not invalidate this talk. Non-spoofed attacks are
easier to block - since the source addresses are known. It is also
possible to fight and eventually destroy the botnets. This is much
harder when the IP's are spoofed.

<hr><div class="image" style="height:364px"><img style="height:336px;" src="strange-loop3-iwi-09-09.009.jpg"></div>

First, all of these attacks are BIG. To be large they must be composed
of a large, a very large number of packets. It's very hard to generate
substantial traffic with legitimate fully established TCP
connections. Instead these record breaking attacks are composed
of a very large number of packets not belonging to valid
sessions. They are often UDP or arbitrary TCP packets.

It's not uncommon that only one in ten thousand packets hitting our
servers is legitimate. Very often the vast majority of packets belong
to the attack.


<hr><div class="image" style="height:364px"><img style="height:336px;" src="strange-loop3-iwi-09-09.010.jpg"></div>

Second shared characteristic shared among the big attacks is that they
all begin with an attacker being able to perform IP Spoofing.

But what is IP spoofing?

<hr><div class="image" style="height:364px"><img style="height:336px;" src="strange-loop3-iwi-09-09.011.jpg"></div>

It's a pretty simple thing. In the internet the data is chopped and
delivered in packets. Each internet packet contains a header in which
there are many of interesting fields, among them the source and
destination IP addresses.

But the packet is just a series of bytes and whoever sends it can
fully control it. If you transmit one over the wire, you can totally
put anything you want inside the packet and inside the headers.

IP spoofing is an idea of rewriting the source IP address. That's it.


<hr><div class="image" style="height:364px"><img style="height:336px;" src="strange-loop3-iwi-09-09.012.jpg"></div>

It might sound benign, but in fact IP spoofing is pretty bad.

One of the problems is that it enables impersonation. From the
receiving end it's impossible to determine if the received packet was
really transmitted by the real host or was maliciously injected into
the internet by some impostor.

<hr><div class="image" style="height:364px"><img style="height:336px;" src="strange-loop3-iwi-09-09.013.jpg"></div>

Long time ago it was recognized that this can lead to
significant problems. In May 2000 a famous document was published,
called BCP 38. BCP stands for Best Current Practices, it's like an
RFC document but a bit less formal.

BCP 38 said clearly - IP spoofing may allow attacks and the internet
community must proactively fight it.

<hr><div class="image" style="height:364px"><img style="height:336px;" src="strange-loop3-iwi-09-09.014.jpg"></div>

Over the last 16 years much progress had been done in this direction,
but it's still not fully solved. According to
[spoofer.caida.org](spoofer.caida.org) project, still about 27% of the
internet service providers do allow their customers to send spoofed IP
packets.

Unfortunately this number is not dropping these days. You may ask:
why? What is so hard about not allowing spoofed packets to be transmitted?

<hr><div class="image" style="height:364px"><img style="height:336px;" src="strange-loop3-iwi-09-09.015.jpg"></div>

This is a long story, but to cut it short: basically the only way to
stop IP spoofing is to do filtering very close to the source, the
party originating the packets. If you have a home DSL connection, the
filtering will be done on your modem. If you own a server it's the
closest switch or router that must filter out the packets with spoofed
IP addresses.

This is not always simple. This requires the ISP's to have hardware
that can do filtering, then to maintain the configuration. It costs
money and expertise.

<hr><div class="image" style="height:364px"><img style="height:336px;" src="strange-loop3-iwi-09-09.016.jpg"></div>

This concludes the introduction to this talk. I explained what IP
spoofing is, that it allows the attacker to impersonate anyone on the
internet.

Then I tried to convince you that the IP spoofing is still an unsolved
problem. The internet community is aware of it for two decades, but
still about 27% of networks allow IP spoofing.

<hr><div class="image" style="height:364px"><img style="height:336px;" src="strange-loop3-iwi-09-09.017.jpg"></div>

Let's move on and focus now on the properties of the attacks caused by
IP spoofing.

Let's start with the first major argument: it's impossible to fight IP
spoofing because the attackers are anonymous.

I'd like to show you that on a concrete example. Let me walk you
through the steps we do when we want to identify who is behind the
attack.

<hr><div class="image" style="height:364px"><img style="height:336px;" src="strange-loop3-iwi-09-09.018.jpg"></div>

When we are tracing back the attack we start, well, by noticing
the attack in the first place. The most obvious way is to look the
inbound packet per second charts. Here you can see such a chart of
packets per second hitting one of our servers.

During normal operation this server was receiving about 50 thousand
packets per second (pps), and then the attack started hitting above
400 thousand pps. A significant increase.

The first step is to figure out what is hitting us.

<hr><div class="image" style="height:364px"><img style="height:336px;" src="strange-loop3-iwi-09-09.019.jpg"></div>

To do that we log in to the attacked server, and run a `tcpdump` to
see what packets are delivered. In this case it was a SYN flood, that
is a flood composed of TCP packets with SYN bit set. If you look
carefully you might notice the source IP's look random - they might
have been spoofed.

<hr><div class="image" style="height:364px"><img style="height:336px;" src="strange-loop3-iwi-09-09.020.jpg"></div>

Now we know what is hitting us. The next question is: where it came
from? How the attack reached our routers?

To do this we look at our router and try to understand out of which
interface the attack came from. Our routers have many interfaces,
connected to multiple parties on the internet. Which one sent us the
attack?


<hr><div class="image" style="height:364px"><img style="height:336px;" src="strange-loop3-iwi-09-09.021.jpg"></div>

To identify this we need to inspect our router charts. Here's an
example screenshot showing charts for four interfaces. In the bottom
left corner you can see two big, 10Gbps, spikes of inbound
traffic. This pattern usually indicates an attack. In this case the
attack was coming from that interface.

<hr><div class="image" style="height:364px"><img style="height:336px;" src="strange-loop3-iwi-09-09.022.jpg"></div>

Who is on the other side of this interface? We need to identify
where the physical cable leads to and who is sending the malicious
traffic.

<hr><div class="image" style="height:364px"><img style="height:336px;" src="strange-loop3-iwi-09-09.023.jpg"></div>

Generally speaking there are three categories of connections coming to
our routers. The attack might have come from any of them.

First, there are a "Direct Peering" also called "PNI"
connections. These are the cables that go directly to some other big
internet entity, for example it could be Google, Amazon, Linode or
maybe Digital Ocean.

Second category of cables are the cables that connect us to local
internet exchanges. An internet exchange is a local community of
mostly regional internet service providers. Internet exchanges are run
in most major cities.

Finally, there is the connectivity that connects us to the
internet. We can't reach the public internet over direct peering nor
over local internet exchanges. To send traffic outside of the current
region we need to be connected to an internet carrier, sometimes
called internet transit or upstream. This is a paid service that
allows us to connect to the public internet.


<hr><div class="image" style="height:364px"><img style="height:336px;" src="strange-loop3-iwi-09-09.024.jpg"></div>

Ok, let's start with direct peering. What happens when we see a large
attack coming from the direct peering interface?

This is a simple story. We pick up a phone and call the other
party. There is no further investigation needed, in this case there is
no other internet entity involved. It's clear who sends us the
malicious traffic.

In the direct peering case the story mostly finishes there. It's in
the interest of both parties to identify the attack source and solve
the problem. We are directly connected only to competent internet
players, and the communication is usually very good. Any problem is
quickly fixed.

This was easy. How about the other two remaining types of connections?

<hr><div class="image" style="height:364px"><img style="height:336px;" src="strange-loop3-iwi-09-09.025.jpg"></div>

What happens if the attack is coming over an internet exchange or
internet carrier link?

Unfortunately it's not that simple. The sad truth is that we can't do
anything about the attack. We have no way to report it and no way to
fix it in the long term. Let me explain.

<hr><div class="image" style="height:364px"><img style="height:336px;" src="strange-loop3-iwi-09-09.026.jpg"></div>

Let's start with internet exchanges. As I mentioned, an internet
exchange is a community of regional ISP's. An exchange is pretty much
a big Layer 2, Ethernet switch. This is a photo of an exchange in
Seattle. As you can see it's a big switch with plenty of Ethernet
cables.

<hr><div class="image" style="height:364px"><img style="height:336px;" src="strange-loop3-iwi-09-09.027.jpg"></div>

These cables go to routers belonging to exchange participants. One of
the cables goes to our router. When we see an attack, from the router
point of view, it would be coming over the internet exchange
interface.

Sadly this is all our router can tell us. The router has no idea who
exactly over the exchange had sent malicious packets. All we see
is that packets are delivered via the exchange, no more details.

This is because routers are optimized to routing packets and look at
IP header. The data on who transmitted the packet is embedded in Layer
2, the Ethernet frame, but mainstream routers can't really inspect
that.

Unfortunately, this means that when we receive an attack coming from
exchange, there is nothing we can do. We don't know which of the local
ISP's is behind the attack. We don't know who is responsible for
the attack.


<hr><div class="image" style="height:364px"><img style="height:336px;" src="strange-loop3-iwi-09-09.028.jpg"></div>

Ok, how about the internet carriers case? Maybe at least they can help us
to identify the attackers.

Unfortunately no. Let me show that on a concrete example.

<hr><div class="image" style="height:364px"><img style="height:336px;" src="strange-loop3-iwi-09-09.029.jpg"></div>

Earlier, in March this year we published a story about particularly
interesting attacks. We named it the "The winter of attacks".

This is one of the charts we published. It shows inbound traffic on one of our
router interfaces. During the incident this particular router, over this
particular cable received about 80Gbps of attack traffic.

<hr><div class="image" style="height:364px"><img style="height:336px;" src="strange-loop3-iwi-09-09.030.jpg"></div>

The interface in question was connected to our internet carrier in Los
Angeles. We noticed an interesting characteristic of the attack
traffic. The source IP addresses of the packets were set to Hurricane
Electric IP ranges. Hurricane Electric is another big internet
provider.

Looks like Hurricane Electric attacking us, right?


<hr><div class="image" style="height:364px"><img style="height:336px;" src="strange-loop3-iwi-09-09.031.jpg"></div>

Not in this case. This is because we actually had a direct connection
to Hurricane Electric in this very data center. If the attack was
really launched from Hurricane Electric, it would come over different interface.

While it is technically possible that the attack could have been
originated at the Hurricane Electric network, and got transmitted over
a public internet, it is highly unlikely. It would have cost them
plenty of money and indicate a fairly broken routing within their
network.

What most likely happened, is that one of our internet carriers
customers was spoofing IP addresses and was impersonating Hurricane Electric.

We called up our carrier and explained the situation, but without much
success. They raised two issues. First, they can't proactively know
that this traffic was indeed spoofed IP traffic. From their point of
view the traffic might well have been legitimate. Second, they don't
have good insight into their network and they really, technically,
don't know who of their customers is transmitting this data.


<hr><div class="image" style="height:364px"><img style="height:336px;" src="strange-loop3-iwi-09-09.032.jpg"></div>

This all leads to a conclusion that for the majority of attacks using IP
spoofing it's impossible to trace back the attacker. It's impossible
to figure out just who sent the malicious traffic.

<hr><div class="image" style="height:364px"><img style="height:336px;" src="strange-loop3-iwi-09-09.033.jpg"></div>

Let's move up to second major argument:IP spoofing allows
sophisticated attacks.

<hr><div class="image" style="height:364px"><img style="height:336px;" src="strange-loop3-iwi-09-09.034.jpg"></div>

I'll try to show three examples of attacks with gradually raising complexity.

Let's start with the details of the "Spamhaus" DNS amplification and
why IP spoofing allowed it.

<hr><div class="image" style="height:364px"><img style="height:336px;" src="strange-loop3-iwi-09-09.035.jpg"></div>

In order to explain amplification, we need to step back first. Let's
talk about a protocol design.

Let's imagine a simple request-response protocol using UDP as the
transport layer. The client asks some query, the server responds with
an answer. This is for example how DNS and NTP work.

<hr><div class="image" style="height:364px"><img style="height:336px;" src="strange-loop3-iwi-09-09.036.jpg"></div>

The idea of amplification comes from abusing this design. The attacker
fakes the request packet, and tricks the server into treating it as
legitimate request. The server, unaware of the real source of the
request, parses it and with all the good will sends the response to
the target. But target never really asked for this data!

This may not sound like a big deal, until you realize that often the
response packet is much larger than the request!

<hr><div class="image" style="height:364px"><img style="height:336px;" src="strange-loop3-iwi-09-09.037.jpg"></div>

For example, it's pretty common in DNS protocol that the request is
trivial, consisting of only couple of bytes. While the answer is large
with hundreds of bytes of payload.

This is the idea of amplification. Instead of sending traffic directly
hassling the target it is possible to generate much larger bandwidth
by bouncing out of some server.

<hr><div class="image" style="height:364px"><img style="height:336px;" src="strange-loop3-iwi-09-09.038.jpg"></div>

Bouncing off one server won't generate much load. But it's possible to
scale up the attack and use an army of exposed UDP servers!

<hr><div class="image" style="height:364px"><img style="height:336px;" src="strange-loop3-iwi-09-09.039.jpg"></div>

This is exactly what happened in March 2013. Back then we were hit by
a very large attack directed at Spamhaus. We estimate that the
attackers had access to three servers with 10Gbps connectivity. In
total they had 30Gbps of IP spoofing capacity. They were able to
amplify this power by bouncing off exposed DNS servers. In the end
this generated 300Gbps of traffic hitting our servers.

<hr><div class="image" style="height:364px"><img style="height:336px;" src="strange-loop3-iwi-09-09.040.jpg"></div>

But I'll claim that amplification is not the most sophisticated type
of attacks these days. First, they're fairly easy to block on
firewall. Blocking DNS amplifications is as simple as dropping
unwanted DNS answers by filtering packets coming from port 53.

Furthermore there are number of initiatives on the internet that try
to clean up exposed servers which could be used for
amplifications. There is the `openresolverproject.org` that tracks exposed
DNS resolvers, then there is `openntpproject.org` looking for
vulnerable NTP servers. And finally there is the `shodan.io` search
engine, which scans the internet and is often helping the ISP's to find
exposed servers in their IP ranges.

<hr><div class="image" style="height:364px"><img style="height:336px;" src="strange-loop3-iwi-09-09.041.jpg"></div>

Let's move on to second attack example. Let's discuss the details of
the "Winter of attacks" mentioned before.

<hr><div class="image" style="height:364px"><img style="height:336px;" src="strange-loop3-iwi-09-09.042.jpg"></div>

This time the attacker didn't use any amplification, but
instead sent spoofed traffic directly against our servers. The attack
volume was pretty large.

<hr><div class="image" style="height:364px"><img style="height:336px;" src="strange-loop3-iwi-09-09.043.jpg"></div>

These are the charts we published. In the bottom one you can see
inbound bandwidth, topping at about 400Gbps. On the top chart you can
see the packets per second metric, going up to 150 million packets per
second.

You can only imagine what would happen if your servers received 150M
pps. They would most likely boil.

<hr><div class="image" style="height:364px"><img style="height:336px;" src="strange-loop3-iwi-09-09.044.jpg"></div>

In this attack type, the packets were sent directly against us. This
means the attacker could choose whatever payload he wanted. The
attacker wasn't limited to crafting DNS or NTP.

In this case the attack was composed of SYN packets. SYN floods are
particularly nasty since you can't just block these packets on
firewall. SYN packets are part of the TCP handshake and dropping them
indiscriminately is not a good idea if you want to keep serving
valid traffic.

<hr><div class="image" style="height:364px"><img style="height:336px;" src="strange-loop3-iwi-09-09.045.jpg"></div>

To be able to distinguish valid from attack packets we need to use
much more precise methods than common firewalls. We found BPF bytecode
to be a very effective tool for that.

Here you can see an example of Linux firewall `iptables`
rule using a BPF bytecode. BPF is this series of numbers.

<hr><div class="image" style="height:364px"><img style="height:336px;" src="strange-loop3-iwi-09-09.046.jpg"></div>

What are these numbers? Well, you can decompile them and print them
out in text form. Here's an example view. As you can see this looks
very much like assembler opcodes, it's because it is! With BPF we can
create simple programs and run them within the Linux firewall. This
allows us to perform deep packet inspection and express a fairly
sophisticated filtering logic as part of a firewall.

<hr><div class="image" style="height:364px"><img style="height:336px;" src="strange-loop3-iwi-09-09.047.jpg"></div>

We found this method very effective, and we created a couple of
scripts to help us with generating the BPF. We open sourced them, and
you can find this in our "BPF Tools" Github repo.

We shared scripts that generate  BPF's for DNS and for
SYN floods. Maybe you will find these useful.

<hr><div class="image" style="height:364px"><img style="height:336px;" src="strange-loop3-iwi-09-09.048.jpg"></div>

But what about source IP addresses? We've already mentioned that
in this particular attack we saw packets spoofed with Hurricane Electric IP
ranges. What about other attacks? Is there anything interesting in
the source IP address field?

Let me show you couple of examples of some other attacks we saw recently.

<hr><div class="image" style="height:364px"><img style="height:336px;" src="strange-loop3-iwi-09-09.049.jpg"></div>

Before we go deeper I owe you an explanation of what you will
see. This is a famous XKCD from 2006, when Randall drew a pretty map
of IP addresses. He tried to draw every netblock and name its owner in
a very pretty way. Visualizing IP addresses in two dimensional space
is not easy, so Randall didn't drew it linearly. Instead he used
something called a Hilbert Curve, which is a fancy way of drawing one
dimensional space, like IP addresses, on two dimensional map, in such
a way that numbers close to each other in binary code will
be drawn close to each other on the map.

<hr><div class="image" style="height:364px"><img style="height:336px;" src="strange-loop3-iwi-09-09.050.jpg"></div>

This is an example of what we saw during one of the attacks. Each
black pixel represents an unique source IP address we saw used in this
particular attack.

As you can see this attack was coming from a number of small "islands"
of IP addresses. Does it mean the IP addresses were spoofed? We don't
know, we can't say that with confidence.


<hr><div class="image" style="height:364px"><img style="height:336px;" src="strange-loop3-iwi-09-09.051.jpg"></div>

But what we can say, is that this is a map of IP ranges belonging to an
ISP called China Telecom.

Once again, previous chart shows IP's used in attack, this one shows
all IP's belonging to China Telecom. What is the moral? I don't know. There are
two ways of interpreting this.

One: someone has a very large botnet which seems to contain only
devices in China Telecom network. Furthermore it seems the bots are
evenly distributed across all the China Telecom IP ranges. This is
possible, I guess.

Another interpretation is that someone looked up IP ranges belonging
to China Telecom and spoofed their IP's with uniform probability.

Which one is correct - I can't tell.

<hr><div class="image" style="height:364px"><img style="height:336px;" src="strange-loop3-iwi-09-09.052.jpg"></div>

Let's move on to my favorite example. In this case the attacker was
generating source IP addresses uniformly from the whole IP address
space. From 0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255. Including all the reserved IP
blocks.

For example in the middle there is a 127.0.0.1 block.

So if you ask us "do you see attacks from localhost?" the answer is:
yes, absolutely! Every other day we see 127.0.0.1 attacking us!

Another one. This time the reserved /8 netblocks were not part of the
attack. But why? I don't know. Either the attacker was smart to avoid
generating obviously wrong IP addresses, or maybe their ISP filtered
the invalid /8 blocks for them?

<hr><div class="image" style="height:364px"><img style="height:336px;" src="strange-loop3-iwi-09-09.054.jpg"></div>

Yet another profile, this one is spoofing only IP addresses with
highest bit set in the most significant IP address byte. I'm not sure
why this pattern was used.

<hr><div class="image" style="height:364px"><img style="height:336px;" src="strange-loop3-iwi-09-09.055.jpg"></div>

Here is my favorite one. On first glance this might look like IP
addresses belonging to some real, big ISP's.  This is how
non-spoofed traffic might have looked like.

But this is not the case. In fact, the completely opposite is
true. What you see here is IP addresses that belong to ranges which
are not routable on the public internet. Someone went through quite a
bit of trouble. He had to scrape the public routing tables, figure out
what net blocks are _not_ present on the public internet, and only
spoof these IP's. Fairly fancy idea.


This concludes the discussion on patterns of source IP's used in
attacks.

<hr><div class="image" style="height:364px"><img style="height:336px;" src="strange-loop3-iwi-09-09.056.jpg"></div>

Let's move on to the last type of attacks I want to discuss. The
"Direct subnet" attacks which we only noticed in June this year.

<hr><div class="image" style="height:364px"><img style="height:336px;" src="strange-loop3-iwi-09-09.057.jpg"></div>

In order to explain the severity of these attacks I first need to
explain the usual mitigation strategy for big attacks.

In a situation when a big attack occurs, the administrators of the
target website often have little choice but to remove the target IP
address from the internet.

This is possible via BGP Nullrouting also called Blackholing. BGP is
the protocol that internet routers speak to each other.

During big attacks when the target has insufficient bandwidth, a
network congestion will occur. This is bad and affects not only the
targeted IP addresses but the whole target network. Sometimes to save
the body you need to sacrifice the limb.

With BGP Nullrouting it is possible to pretty much remove target IP
address from the internet and therefore relieve the congestion. This
is the tool of last resource.


<hr><div class="image" style="height:364px"><img style="height:336px;" src="strange-loop3-iwi-09-09.058.jpg"></div>

In June we saw a very dangerous type of the attack. We saw a big flood
of packets directed against the whole subnet, not against a single
target IP address. This is highly unusual. Normally the attacks target
only a couple addresses.

This is also extremely dangerous. With 255 IP addresses attacked it is
not technically possible to perform nullrouting. This renders the
DDoS mitigation method of last resort useless.

<hr><div class="image" style="height:364px"><img style="height:336px;" src="strange-loop3-iwi-09-09.059.jpg"></div>

This leads us with a sad conclusion that the only way to survive big
DDoS attacks is to absorb the traffic.

<hr><div class="image" style="height:364px"><img style="height:336px;" src="strange-loop3-iwi-09-09.060.jpg"></div>

The only way to keep services online is to have enough network
capacity to receive the attack, and enough processing power to be able
to process and filter all the packets.

Unfortunately bandwidth and hardware are expensive. Furthermore these
resources will mostly stay idle, being utilized only during big attacks.

<hr><div class="image" style="height:364px"><img style="height:336px;" src="strange-loop3-iwi-09-09.061.jpg"></div>

This is one of the forces that causes centralization in the internet. In order to
stay online, serious websites must use some kind of DDoS mitigation
service. There are only a couple of big such providers on the
internet, and they have enormous leverage.

<hr><div class="image" style="height:364px"><img style="height:336px;" src="strange-loop3-iwi-09-09.062.jpg"></div>

This is not good and I believe it erodes the principles of the
internet. The internet was originally created as a collection of equal
connected peers. Everyone connected had equal rights, could consume
content, produce content.

It was normal to host DNS or HTTP services on your home land-line.

But this is not possible anymore. It's just too easy to knock
unprotected websites off line.

<hr><div class="image" style="height:364px"><img style="height:336px;" src="strange-loop3-iwi-09-09.063.jpg"></div>

We described the problem and painted a pretty grim look for current
state of the situation. Is there any way to solve it?

I believe there is.

<hr><div class="image" style="height:364px"><img style="height:336px;" src="strange-loop3-iwi-09-09.064.jpg"></div>

First we need to agree that the technical solutions to solve IP
spoofing had failed. The internet community created the BCP 38
document 16 years ago, and we still have 27% of network providers
allowing IP spoofing.

<hr><div class="image" style="height:364px"><img style="height:336px;" src="strange-loop3-iwi-09-09.065.jpg"></div>

The reality is that we must learn to live in a world where IP spoofing
is an unavoidable fact.

<hr><div class="image" style="height:364px"><img style="height:336px;" src="strange-loop3-iwi-09-09.066.jpg"></div>

I think the internet community tried to solve the wrong problem.

Instead of focusing on IP spoofing we should have focused on a broader
problem: the attribution. I really don't care what bits are in the
source IP field of the attack packets. What I want to know is just who is
attacking me.

<hr><div class="image" style="height:364px"><img style="height:336px;" src="strange-loop3-iwi-09-09.067.jpg"></div>

I would love to get support of internet exchange operators.
Please help me out with identifying which of the connected peer is
transmitting the majority of attack packets.

<hr><div class="image" style="height:364px"><img style="height:336px;" src="strange-loop3-iwi-09-09.068.jpg"></div>

The same goes to internet carriers. I'd like them to contribute and
help with identifying which of their customers transmitted the attack.

But how to do this? We've already said that the internet carriers often
lack any insight into their network.

<hr><div class="image" style="height:364px"><img style="height:336px;" src="strange-loop3-iwi-09-09.070.jpg"></div>

Well, they should just use netflow.

Netflow is an awesome protocol supported by all major router vendors.

<hr><div class="image" style="height:364px"><img style="height:336px;" src="strange-loop3-iwi-09-09.071.jpg"></div>

It allows routers to sample the traffic and send sampled data to a
central place, called "collector". With properly configured netflow a
router will report every thousandth, or ten thousandth connection to
the collector.

This data contains the router interface numbers, which is precisely
what we need. This would allow us to answer the question: over which
interface the attack entered the carrier network.

<hr><div class="image" style="height:364px"><img style="height:336px;" src="strange-loop3-iwi-09-09.072.jpg"></div>

Netflow is well supported by open source tools. Installing the
collector is as simple as "apt-get install". Netflow scales up well,
it can support truly big networks.

Proposing more logging may sound icky from the privacy point
of view. This is a valid concern, but there are two caveats.

First, netflow allows to customize a high sampling rate. I could be
set to the maximum value of only one per 64000 connections
tracked. This sampling rate is absolutely sufficient for the large
DDoS reporting. The big attacks will be still clearly visible.

Secondly, there is no need to keep old logs available. For the DDoS
reporting, the logs could be rolled every coupe of days. We really
care only about recent events.

<hr><div class="image" style="height:364px"><img style="height:336px;" src="strange-loop3-iwi-09-09.073.jpg"></div>

To convince you it's simple, here's an example of an `nfdump` command
used to query the collector. Here we ask a question: what attacks were
seen in last 5 minutes coming over a specific interface in Warsaw.

You can do much more with `nfdump`. This is just an example.

There are also much prettier backends to the netflow database. Using
command line is just one way of querying it.

<hr><div class="image" style="height:364px"><img style="height:336px;" src="strange-loop3-iwi-09-09.074.jpg"></div>

Asking internet carriers to deploy netflow is only the first step. It
won't solve the attacks.

<hr><div class="image" style="height:364px"><img style="height:336px;" src="strange-loop3-iwi-09-09.075.jpg"></div>

But being able to attribute the attacks will at least allow us to
finally have an informed discussion. We can't have it now. We are in
total darkness. Who is behind the attacks? Is that rogue ISP? Is that
a script kiddie with access to couple of beefy hacked servers? Is that
a state actor? We just don't know.

<hr><div class="image" style="height:364px"><img style="height:336px;" src="strange-loop3-iwi-09-09.076.jpg"></div>

That's all I have. Thanks for being with me! I hope the talk was informative.

A quick recap. I believe that the threat of DDoS attacks is one of the
forces causing centralization in the internet.  In order to fix this
we need to fix DDoS. In order to fix the big DDoS attacks we need to
be able to trace them back and pinpoint who is behind them.

<hr><div class="image" style="height:364px"><img style="height:336px;" src="strange-loop3-iwi-09-09.077.jpg"></div>

Hopefully, once we solve the attribution we'll be able to step by step
tackle the DDoS and the internet will be better for everyone.
